This approach is a gene expression study or a correlational study to examine how changes in the expression of a single gene correlate with certain phenotypes. In this case, my gene of interest correlates with multiple metabolic and muscle phenotypes indicative of disease. I also used the top 2000 gene correlations with my gene of interest to conduct an enrichment analysis for the purpose of identifying possible pathways that the gene of interest is involved in. Such studies are crucial for understanding the functional implications of specific genes and can provide insights into biological pathways and mechanisms underlying diseases or traits. All analyses and data extraction for this project were performed with R.
